The Bloody Beetroots first exploded on the scene via his 2009 critically acclaimed debut album ‘Romborama,’ featuring the iconic track “Warp 1.9.” with Steve Aoki, both of which helped launch the American EDM boom at the end of the 2000s. His 2013 sophomore album, ‘Hide,’ featured crossover tracks with rock icons and alternative stars like Sir Paul McCartney, Tommy Lee and others. Rifo’s third full-length album, ‘The Great Electronic Swindle’ (2017), continued the electronic-rock narrative via collaborations with Perry Farrell, JET, Gallows, Deap Vally and more. In 2019, The Bloody Beetroots will release the ‘Heavy’ EP, which sees Rifo revisiting his classic electro style and features collaborations with Ephwurd and Dr. Fresch, in addition to three new solo originals. Via his boundary-pushing full live band shows and DJ sets, The Bloody Beetroots has performed at every major music festival around the world in addition to several headlining solo tours.

They achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement; they also had success in the years following, combining elements of house music with funk, techno, disco, rock and synthpop. They have worn ornate helmets and gloves to assume robot personas in most public appearances since 1999 and rarely grant interviews or appear on television. The duo were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (also known as Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.

Their debut studio album Homework was released by Virgin Records in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by singles "Around the World" and "Da Funk". Their second album, Discovery, had further success, supported by hit singles "One More Time", "Digital Love" and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger". In March 2005, Daft Punk released their third album, Human After All, to mixed reviews, though the singles "Robot Rock" and "Technologic" achieved success in the United Kingdom. Daft Punk toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album Alive 2007, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album. In 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin for Columbia Records, and released their fourth album, Random Access Memories, to acclaim; lead single "Get Lucky" reached the top 10 in the charts of 32 countries. Random Access Memories won five Grammy Awards in 2014, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for "Get Lucky". In 2016, Daft Punk gained their first number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with the song "Starboy", a collaboration with The Weeknd. As of 2015, Daft Punk had sold over 12 million albums worldwide.'})

#   Rising from the depths of the underworld, the mysterious producer known as GosT embodies the character of Baalberith, a prince of Hell, on his propulsive synthwave solo project. Channeling the occult, \'80s slasher flicks, and John Carpenter, GosT occupies the space amongst the muscular electro-house sounds of Justice, the rhythmic sheen of Perturbator, and the industrial-black metal influence of Anaal Nathrakh.<br><br>Though his initial electronic work was performed under the Nightrunner moniker, GosT was truly born in 2013. After issuing three starter EPs (Radio Macabre, The Night Prowler, and Nocturnal Shift), GosT expanded to the lengthier short albums Skull and GosT. He released his critically acclaimed debut LP, Behemoth, in 2015, quickly following with the hugely successful Non Paradisi album in 2016, which was inspired by the fall of Lucifer in Milton\'s Paradise Lost. <br> On March 23rd 2018, the dark lord of slasherwave returns with his most extreme work to date: “Possessor”, a shocking and aggressive demolition of sound and spirit. Molding his trademark buzzsaw basslines and crystalline synth leads together with amplified blastbeats, GosT pushes forward to edges of synthwave and beyond as he breaks the genre wide open and makes it his own.'})

Erez Aizen\'s cheap background in obsessed bedroom computer tinkering had led him into and out of a number of crude dance efforts, and when a mutual friend suggested he should get together with Amit Duvdevani, a thrash metal fan who had just returned from an aborted career path in India, the two found enough in common to surreptitiously explore the rising psychedelic trends pouring out of the nation\'s clubs. The results -- 1999\'s The Gathering, which was heavily inspired by the surreal ambient dance of Simon Posford, X-Dream, and Transwave, and 2000\'s Classical Mushroom, an aggressively melodic trance LP that broke the European, Japanese, and American markets -- elevated Infected Mushroom to one of Israel\'s key trance production duos.
#  The duo\'s third album, B.P. Empire, found them deviating a bit from their established psy-trance sound, experimenting with classical and Middle Eastern-influenced melodies and slower tempos. The 2003 double CD Converting Vegetarians took this genre experimentation further, designating one disc for more straightforward trance tracks and a second disc with tracks ranging from ambient and abstract electronic music to synth pop and downtempo. IM the Supervisor followed in 2004, and found the duo adding new production techniques and influences as well as an increased presence of vocals. The album was more accessible than previous efforts and became their most commercially successful release to date. '})

# rezz = Dj.create({name: 'Rezz', genre: 'Drum&Bass EDM Techno', nationality: 'Ukraine 🇺🇦', bio: 'Isabelle Rezazadeh, (born March 28, 1995; Ukraine) known by her stage name Rezz (stylized as REZZ), is a Canadian DJ and record producer from Niagara Falls, Ontario. She released her debut EP, Insurrection in 2015 through OWSLAs sub-label Nest HQ. In 2016, she signed with Deadmau5\'s record label Mau5trap, and released follow-ups The Silence is Deafening and Something Wrong Here. On August 4, 2017, Rezazadeh released her debut studio album, Mass Manipulation, with its follow up, Certain Kind of Magic, released in 2018. 
#   Ethnically Persian-Ukrainian, Rezazadeh was born in Ukraine and was raised by her Ukrainian mother and Iranian father, before moving to Canada at a young age. While attending high school, she worked at Hard Rock Cafe at Niagara Falls. She was fired from her job after skipping work on weekends to attend festivals. She traveled to Toronto infrequently, and attended dubstep shows by artists like Bassnectar, Pretty Lights, Zeds Dead, amongst others. Rezz\'s involvement in the Toronto scene helped grow her gritty style. Events like Bassmentality and older shows at The Guvernment nightclub helped shape not only Rezz, but an era of electronic music producers who became inspired from early DJ college tours. Rezazadeh began DJing at the age of 16, playing music by other artists until she became inspired by a Deadmau5 concert to create her own. She was noticed on a blog by Skrillex, who then followed and sent her a message on Twitter. In 2020, she began dating Florida-based DJ Lucii The Alien.'})

John Cage was one of the earliest composers to use the term and one of experimental music\'s primary innovators, utilizing indeterminacy techniques and seeking unknown outcomes. In France, as early as 1953, Pierre Schaeffer had begun using the term musique expérimentale to describe compositional activities that incorporated tape music, musique concrète, and elektronische Musik. Also, in America, a quite distinct sense of the term was used in the late 1950s to describe computer-controlled composition associated with composers such as Lejaren Hiller.

It was created by DJs and music producers from Chicago\'s underground club culture in the 1980s, as DJs from the subculture began altering disco dance tracks to give them a more mechanical beat and deeper basslines. 
  
#   The genre was pioneered by DJs and producers mainly from Chicago and New York such as Frankie Knuckles, Larry Levan, Ron Hardy, Jesse Saunders, Chip E., Steve "Silk" Hurley, Farley "Jackmaster" Funk, Mr. Fingers, Marshall Jefferson, Phuture, and many others. Its origins derive from within the Black American LGBT communities but has since spread to the mainstream. 
  
#   From its beginnings in the Chicago club and local radio scene, the genre expanded internationally to London, then to other American cities such as New York City and Detroit before becoming a worldwide phenomenon. It has spawned numerous subgenres, such as acid house, deep house, hip house, ghetto house, progressive house, tech house, electro house, and many more.', artist_ids: []})

Such music attempted to explore alternate approaches to rock music production. Some acts also attempted to elevate the aesthetic values of rock music by incorporating features associated with classical instrumental music. 
  
#   This led to a style of music called progressive rock, which has been described as "the most self-consciously arty branch of rock." In disco music, and later house music, a similar desire to separate more exploratory styles from standard approaches saw DJs and producers adopting the word "progressive" to make a distinction.

#   The music originally had a clean and minimal production style that was associated with techno from Detroit and the UK. In the mid to late 1990s, a scene developed in England around club nights such as The Drop run by the former Shamen rapper Mr C (Richard West) & Paul "Rip" Stone (co-founder with West of Plink Plonk), Heart & Soul and Wiggle run by Terry Francis and Nathan Coles.

#   Artists may use electronic instruments such as drum machines, sequencers, and synthesizers, as well as digital audio workstations. Drum machines from the 1980s such as Roland\'s TR-808 and TR-909 are highly prized, and software emulations of such retro instruments are popular. 
  
#   The term "techno" originated in Germany in the early 1980s, but it was established as a name for a specific genre of electronic dance music produced in Detroit following the UK release of the 1988 compilation Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit. Detroit techno resulted from the melding of synthpop by artists such as Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder and Yellow Magic Orchestra with African American styles such as house, electro, and funk. 
  
#   Added to this is the influence of futuristic and science-fiction themes relevant to life in American late capitalist society, with Alvin Toffler\'s book The Third Wave a notable point of reference. The music produced in the mid to late 1980s by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson (collectively known as the Belleville Three), along with Eddie Fowlkes, Blake Baxter and James Pennington is viewed as the first wave of techno from Detroit. 
  
#   After the success of house music in a number of European countries, techno grew in popularity in the UK, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. In Europe regional variants quickly evolved and by the early 1990s techno subgenres such as acid, hardcore, ambient, and dub techno had developed.

At the same time trance music was developing in Europe, the genre was also gathering a following in the Indian state of Goa. 
  
#   Trance music is characterized by a tempo lying between 110–150 bpm (BPM), repeating melodic phrases and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 "peaks" or "drops". Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno, house, pop, chill-out, classical music, tech house, ambient and film music. 
  
#   A trance is a state of hypnotism and heightened consciousness. This is portrayed in trance music by the mixing of layers with distinctly foreshadowed build-up and release. A common characteristic of trance music is a mid-song climax followed by a soft breakdown disposing of beats and percussion entirely, leaving the melody or atmospherics to stand alone for an extended period before gradually building up again. 
  
#   Trance tracks are often lengthy to allow for such progression and commonly have sufficiently sparse opening and closing sections to facilitate mixing by DJs. Trance is mostly instrumental, although vocals can be mixed in: typically they are performed by mezzo-soprano to soprano female soloists, often without a traditional verse/chorus structure.
